# DemoProfileCreation
Project to Demo Profile creation of User 

The Project is developed as per the specs for the assignment 
1-It has Profile creation screen with the required fields
2- It has sign in screen 
3-when user clicks sign in - I have designed a new page  to show Mock success page with animation.
[this is part of the Additional items â€¢ Feel free to surprise us with anything else]

Architecture:
1-designed mock ViewModel and network layer to show how the sign in network call would look like
2-model, viewcontroller, storyboards,xibs are separated
UserInfo - structure contains the data to be passed from 1st screen to 2nd
ProfileCreationViewController defines the first screen
SignInViewController defines the 2nd screen
SignInSuccessViewController defines the success screen 


salient features
1-CAGradientLayer has been leveraged to color the background of submit/sign in button
2-CAEmitterLayer is used for the animation effect


In progress:
Unit testing
